GCP Services:
-------------
1) Cloud storage:
-----------------
Google cloud storage is an online file storage service provided by Google as part of its cloud computing platform.
It allows to store and retrieve data in the cloud, which makes it accessible from anywhere with the help of an 
internet connection.

2) Compute Engine:
------------------
Google compute is a cloud computing service that provides virtual machines for running applications and services. 
It allows one to easily create, configure, and manage virtual machines with various operating systems and hardware
configurations. 

3) Big Query:
-------------
BigQuery is a cloud-based datawarehouse provided by Google Cloud Platform that allows you to store, analyze, and query
large datasets using SQL-like syntax. It is a serverless, highly scalable, cost effective solution that can process 
and analyze terabytes to petabytes of data in real-time. 

4) Looker:
----------
Looker studio is a web-based data visualization and reporting tool that allows to create interactive dashboards and reports
from a variety of data sources, including Google analytics, Google sheets, and BigQuery. It enables you to turn your data 
into informative and engaging visualizations, which can be easily shared and collaborated on with others. 




Fact and Dimension Table:
-------------------------
Fact Table:
-----------
- Contains quantitative measures or metrics that are used for analysis.
- Typically contains foreign keys that link to dimension tables.
- Contains columns that have high cardinality and change frequently.
- Contains columns that are not used by analysis by themselves, but are necessary for calculating metrics

Dimension Table:
----------------
- Contains columns that describe attributes of the data being analyzed.
- Typically contains primary keys that link to fact tables.
- Contains columns that have low cardinality and don't change frequently.
- Contains columns that can be used for grouping or filtering data for analysis.
